For example: **Photo (23).jpg**

#### Requeriments:	
	Python 2.x

	Nautilus or a derivated file manager (Caja, Nemo)

#### Installation: 
You must copy this file in /home/<user>/.local/share/nautilus/scripts and give it executation permissions.
For Caja or Nemo modify line 38: 
**"NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS"** to **"CAJA_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS"** or 
**"NEMO_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS"**

#### Usage:

Right click on the selected files that you want to rename (you can include folders). Open the context menu
and click in Scripts->Renamer. Simple window will be opened and write in it the new name for the files.
